# Simple Python  DataFrame - CSV API Application

This project demonstrates a simple Python application that processes CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files using the **Pandas** library. The application includes functionalities such as loading a CSV file, printing its records, counting the records, and reversing the order of the records.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure the following requirements are met:

- **Python 3.12.7** installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python and virtual environments.

---

## Setup Guide

### 1. Install Python 3.12.7
- Download and install Python 3.12.7 from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
- Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
- Create a virtual environment by running:
  - `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate the virtual environment:
  - **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`
  - **Mac/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`

### 3. Install Dependencies
- Install the Pandas library by running:
  - `pip install pandas`

---

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
  - `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git`
  - `cd repository-name`

### 2. Add Your CSV File
- Place the CSV file you want to process in the project directory.
- Update the file path in the application file (`app.py`) if needed.

### 3. Run the Application
- Run the Python application:
  - `python app.py`

## Features

1. **Load a CSV File**
   - Loads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

2. **Print Each Record**
   - Prints every record in the CSV file, treating each row as a separate record.

3. **Count and Display the Number of Records**
   - Displays the total number of records in the CSV file.

4. **Reverse the Order of Records**
   - Reverses the order of the records and saves the result to a new CSV file. The output file is named `reversed_<original_filename>.csv`.

---

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the main script for processing the CSV file.
- `venv/`: The virtual environment folder.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project setup and features.
